## Slidify

### An R package for Creating slides from R Markdown.

*Slidify Philosophy*: Separate the content writing from the its rendering.

<div class='well'>
<p><b> Note: </b> we can embed nodes using HTML (with the bootstrap widget)</p>
</div>

*** pnotes

I need to focus on the following
 - key point
 - other key point
 - clever anecdote

## Using ggplot

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_hex()

```

Use `echo=FALSE` to hide the code block on your slide.

---

## Equations
Write equations just like you would in LaTeX.

The Arithmetic mean is equal to $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=i}^{n} x_{i}$, or the summation
of n numbers divided by n.

$$ H(X)=-\sum_{i}{P(x_i) log_b P(x_i)} $$

```
$$ H(X)=-\sum_{i}{P(x_i) log_b P(x_i)} $$
```
In the starting YAML, make sure to include 

```
widgets : [mathjax]
```

---

## Syntax Highlighting

Use fenced code blocks to render Python code with syntax highlighting.

```python
def hello():
  '''
  Such a boring function
  '''
  print 'hi!'
  
if __name__ == '__main__':
  hello()
```

## Getting Started with Slidify

You have to use Hadley's `devtools` package to download and install Slidify from Github.

```r
library(devtools)
install_github('slidify', 'ramnathv')
install_github('slidifyLibraries', 'ramnathv')
```

It is simple to create a new presentation.

```r
library(slidify)

#Create a new presentation called 'mydeck'
author('mydeck')
```

Slidify does much of the setup work for you (including creating the github repo). 
You just need to edit the `index.Rmd` file!

---

## Publishing your Presentation

When you are ready to share your handiwork.

```r
# Generate the Deck
slidify('index.Rmd')

# Publish it to github
publish(user='rjwalls', repo='SlidifyTest', host='github')
```

Puts the presentation at <http://rjwalls.github.com/SlidifyTest>. Note that you need to setup your [Github SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys).  

Can also use Rpubs or Dropbox.

## R Markdown

### You can use all of the features you love in Rmarkdown including:
 - bullets

### As well as numbered lists:
 1. Thing 1
 2. Thing 2
 
### Animated lists:
> - This is probably specific to IO2012
> - Point 2
 
*Italicized* and **bold** font.

---

## IO2012 

The default slide framework is `io2012` from Google's 2012 I/O developer conference.

Adds some nice presenter features
 - Pressing 'h' highlights code snippets
 - Pressing 'p' toggles speaker notes (if they're on the current slide)
 - Pressing 'f' toggles fullscreen viewing
 - Pressing 'w' toggles widescreen
 - Pressing 'o' toggles overview mode
 - Pressing 'ESC' toggles off these goodies
 
Append [`?presentme=true`](http://rjwalls.github.io/SlidifyTest/) to the presentation url to get the presenter view. Use [`?presentme=false`](http://rjwalls.github.io/SlidifyTest/) to disable presenter mode.

---

Slide level metadata are specified as key:value pairs. 
Commonly specified metadata like id, class and layout can also be identified by prefixing with punctuation marks #, . and & respectively. 

```
--- &vcenter
```

```
--- .segue .dark
```

```
--- .segue .quote .dark, bg:url(allyourbase.jpg)
```

--- &vcenter

![Lime cat](limecat.jpg)
Lime cat is important.

--- .segue .dark

## Segue Slide

--- .segue .quote .dark, bg:url(allyourbase.jpg)

<q> All your base are belong to us. </q>

## Tables

Column 1  | Column 2
----------|---------
Foo       | Bar
Blah      | Blah
Bing      | Bang


---

## Tables from a Data.frame

```{r, results='asis', echo=T}
library(plyr)

df <- diamonds[seq(1,5), ]
df <- with(df, cbind(price, carat, cut, clarity))

# Make the header
header <- paste(colnames(df), collapse=' | ')
dashline <- paste(rep(c('---'), length(colnames(df))), collapse=' | ')

# Add the data
data <-aaply(df, 1, paste, collapse=' | ')
```

---

## Tables from a Data.frame

```{r, results='asis'}
cat(header, dashline, data, sep='\n')
```

Make sure to set `results='asis'`.

## Slide with a Background Image 

--- &twocol

## Two Column Layout   
### This slide *does not* have two columns

*** =left
    
 - point 1
 - point 2
 - point 3

*** =right

 1. point 4
 2. point 5
